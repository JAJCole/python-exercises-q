# Import and test 3 of the functions from your functions exercise file. Import each function in a different way:

# Run an interactive python session and import the module. Call the is_vowel function using the . syntax.
#   Create a file named import_exericses.py. Within this file, use from to import the calculate_tip function directly. Call this function with values you choose and print the result.
#   Create a jupyter notebook named import_exercises.ipynb. Use from to import the get_letter_grade function and give it an alias. Test this function in your notebook.

# Make sure your code that tests the function imports is run from the same directory that your functions exercise file is in.
